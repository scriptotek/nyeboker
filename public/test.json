Sethna's book takes this step for statistical mechanics--a field rooted in physics and chemistry whose ideas and methods are now central to information theory, complexity, and modern biology. Aimed at advanced undergraduates and early graduate students in all of these fields, Sethna limits his main presentation to the topics that future mathematicians and biologists, as well as physicists and chemists, will find fascinating and central to their work. The amazing breadth of the field is reflected in the author's large supply of carefully crafted exercises, each an introduction to a whole field of study: everything from chaos through information theory to life at the end of the universe.\n\u00a9 Copyright in bibliographic data is held by Nielsen Book Services Limited or its licensors: all rights reserved.

The data may be used as described here","long_desc":"Compressed sensing is an exciting, rapidly growing field, attracting considerable attention in electrical engineering, applied mathematics, statistics and computer science. This book provides the first detailed introduction to the subject, highlighting recent theoretical advances and a range of applications, as well as outlining numerous remaining research challenges. After a thorough review of the basic theory, many cutting-edge techniques are presented, including advanced signal modeling, sub-Nyquist sampling of analog signals, non-asymptotic analysis of random matrices, adaptive sensing, greedy algorithms and use of graphical models. All chapters are written by leading researchers in the field, and consistent style and notation are utilized throughout. Key background information and clear definitions make this an ideal resource for researchers, graduate students and practitioners wanting to join this exciting research area. It can also serve as a supplementary textbook for courses on computer vision, coding theory, signal processing, image processing and algorithms for efficient data processing.\n\u00a9 Copyright in bibliographic data is held by Nielsen Book Services Limited or its licensors: all rights reserved.
